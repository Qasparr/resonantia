resonance/player/tempo.py -- the master BPM slider's engine: whole-mix
tempo control with pitch preserved.

Hypothesis: a DJ-style master tempo slider must change playback SPEED
  without changing PITCH (a chipmunk on fast, a drunk on slow, is a
  resampler, not a time-stretcher). True pitch-preserving time-stretch
  is a serious DSP problem -- the honest implementation here is the
  open-source Rubber Band library (the `rubberband` CLI), used as a
  subprocess adapter with the work proven by real tool output, not by
  reimplementation.
Method:     TimeStretcher -- a small adapter interface (probe / stretch).
  RubberBandAdapter shells to `rubberband --time <ratio>` on temp WAV
  files written/read through resonance.core.io (so the workspace float32
  mono/stereo contract holds on both sides). NumpyResampleStretcher is
  the pure-numpy fallback: plain linear resampling that changes tempo
  AND pitch together -- honestly labeled rehearsal-grade everywhere it
  appears, because calling it "pitch-preserving" would be a lie.
  MasterTempo wraps one adapter with ratio validation and loud fallback.
Observation: when `rubberband` is absent, RubberBandAdapter raises
  LoudMissingBackend naming the tool and how to install it; MasterTempo
  built with adapter="auto" falls back to the numpy resampler and says
  so in its state (`.fallback_reason` / `describe()`), never silently.
Result:    tests cover the interface, ratio validation, artifact
  documentation, and the honest fallback labeling.

Artifact honesty (applies to ALL time-stretching, Rubber Band included):
  ratios between ~0.5x and ~2.0x are the tool's comfort zone; outside it
  transients smear, sustained tones phasiness/warble, percussion flams
  and pre-echoes. MasterTempo logs a warning past 2x in either direction
  and documents it here instead of pretending the magic is free.

No medical or therapeutic claims are made about tempo or time-stretch;
this is signal processing plumbing.
