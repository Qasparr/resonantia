resonance/diagnostics/measure.py -- real throughput benchmarking.

Hypothesis: render functions can be honestly benchmarked by timing them
  with time.perf_counter and dividing real samples rendered by real
  seconds elapsed -- no simulated numbers, no estimates.
Method:     run render_fn(*args, **kwargs) n_runs times, time each with
  perf_counter, count result.size samples per run.
Observation: samples_per_second is finite and positive for any real
  renderer; a function returning garbage (non-array, empty) fails loudly.
Result:     a dict with wall time and throughput, asserted sane.

Uses only the render function's PUBLIC call signature -- measure never
reaches into module internals.

# MECHANISM: numpy is imported LAZILY (inside the functions that need
#   it), never at module import. Rationale, filed 2026-10-08: on
#   Android (Chaquopy) the v0.6.0 app died on launch, and the startup
#   import chain's only native code was numpy (via this module,
#   pulled in by resonance.api.service.create_app). Deferring the
#   native import out of the startup path both tests that hypothesis
#   and keeps `import resonance.diagnostics` cheap everywhere.
# DOCTRINE:  a measuring tool must not demand the heavy machinery
#   just to be picked up. Import light; pay for numpy per use.
