resonance/diagnostics/verify.py -- FFT verification of entrainment renders.

Hypothesis: a correctly rendered binaural beat has an FFT-verifiable
  signature -- each stereo channel peaks at its own carrier, and the two
  peaks differ by exactly the beat rate.
Method:     rFFT each channel (Hann-windowed to contain leakage), find the
  spectral peak nearest the expected carrier via parabolic interpolation,
  compare against carrier +/- beat/2 and against each other.
Observation: a 10 Hz / 528 Hz render peaks at ~523 Hz (L) and ~533 Hz (R);
  a render mistuned to 12 Hz but labeled 10 Hz fails every check by ~1 Hz.
Result:     a verdict dict; tests assert passed=True on good renders and
  passed=False on mistuned ones. No exceptions for mistuning -- a failed
  verification is data, not a crash.

Uses only PUBLIC APIs (numpy, and the buffer contract shapes). No medical
or therapeutic claims are involved; this certifies frequencies, nothing
more.

# MECHANISM: numpy is imported LAZILY (see _np below), never at module
#   import -- same rationale as diagnostics/measure.py (2026-10-08):
#   keep native code out of the import chain so `import
#   resonance.diagnostics` stays light on every platform, Android
#   included.
# DOCTRINE:  certifying a frequency must not require loading the
#   number-cruncher just to pick up the certificate.
