resonance/metadata/musicbrainz.py -- MusicBrainz recording lookup.

Hypothesis: canonical identity for a track (the MBID) is worth
  fetching from the one public database that issues them, and
  worth fetching HONESTLY: with a real User-Agent (their policy
  requires one), at their 1 req/sec rate limit, over plain stdlib
  urllib with timeouts -- no heavy client library, no hidden
  retries that hammer someone else's volunteer server.
Method:     every public function takes an optional `transport`
  callable: transport(url, headers) -> bytes. When None, the
  stdlib urllib transport is used, wrapped in the rate limiter
  (1 req/sec, MusicBrainz's published limit) and in loud error
  translation: URLError/timeouts become RuntimeError naming the
  endpoint, the failure, and the remedy. Tests inject a stub
  transport with canned JSON and never touch the network.
Observation: search_recording("Pink Floyd", "Time") returns a list
  of dicts with mbid/score/artist/title; get_recording(mbid)
  returns details incl. first release title and date.
Result:     the identity half of v0.2.0's metadata fetchers.
  Network failure is always a loud RuntimeError -- never None,
  never a silent guess at an MBID (a guessed identity is a lie
  the whole pipeline would then repeat).
